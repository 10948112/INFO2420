    <h2>Trader Joe’s – <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/">www.traderjoes.com</a></h2>

    <p><b>First Impression:</b> My first thought was that it looks kind of fun and colorful. It feels different from a normal grocery store site.</p>

    <p><b>Information Flow:</b> The main links are across the top (products, recipes, etc.). It was easy to see where things are.</p>

    <p><b>Structure:</b> The layout is simple and makes sense. I didn’t get lost or confused.</p>

    <p><b>Graphics/Layout:</b> The pictures are bright and make the page look more interesting. They don’t get in the way.</p>

    <p><b>Load Time:</b> It loaded pretty quick on my computer, just a second or two.</p>

    <p><b>Text Readability:</b> The text was fine to read. The background is plain so nothing clashed.</p>

    <p><b>Navigation:</b> Yes, there’s a bar at the top for navigation. It worked fine for me.</p>

    <p><b>Color Scheme:</b> The site mainly uses red and white. The same look shows up on all the pages I clicked.</p>

    <p><b>Responsive Design:</b> When I made the window smaller, it adjusted so I could still read everything. Looked okay on my phone too.</p>

    <p><b>Unusual/Well Done:</b> The “Fearless Flyer” part stood out. It’s like a mini magazine and kind of fun to scroll through.</p>
